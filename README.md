## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Key configuration files:

- `scripts/generate-static.js`: Static HTML generation settings
- `scripts/generate-sitemap.js`: Sitemap configuration
- `src/utils/schemaGenerators.ts`: Structured data templates

## üß© Deployment to Netlify

This project is designed to be built locally and then deployed to Netlify:

1. Build the static files locally using one of these commands:
   - `npm run build:local` - Basic local build
   - `npm run build:local:with-images` - Build with image generation
   - `npm run build:production` - Full production build with optimizations

2. Test the build locally with `npm run serve:static`

3. Deploy the pre-built files to Netlify:
   - The netlify.toml is configured to use pre-built files from the dist directory
   - Netlify will NOT run a build process and will simply serve the pre-built files
   - This approach prevents build errors on Netlify and ensures image consistency

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: Do not configure Netlify to run its own build. The project must be built locally to ensure all image and data consistency issues are resolved before deployment.
