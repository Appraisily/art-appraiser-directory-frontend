# Standardized Build Process

## Overview

This document outlines the new standardized build process for the Art Appraiser Directory frontend. This approach simplifies the build process and ensures consistent data across the application.

## Features

- Standardized data format with consistent field names and structure
- Simplified build process that focuses on essential steps
- Enhanced SEO with structured schema.org markup
- Improved UI with detailed appraiser profiles
- Better search and filtering capabilities

## Architecture Changes

### Data Layer

We've replaced the fragmented data structure with a standardized schema:

- `/src/data/standardized/` - Contains all location data in a consistent format
- `standardizedData.ts` - New utility to load and access standardized data
- `StandardizedAppraiser` and `StandardizedLocation` types - Well-defined interfaces

### Components

New components that leverage the standardized data:

- `StandardizedLocationPage.tsx` - Enhanced location page with better UI
- `StandardizedAppraiserPage.tsx` - Comprehensive appraiser profile page

### Build Process

Simplified build script that:

1. Verifies standardized data exists (generating it if needed)
2. Builds the React application
3. Updates links to point to the main domain
4. Prepares for deployment

## How to Use

### Build Commands

```bash
# Default build using standardized data
npm run build

# Explicitly use standardized build
npm run build:standardized

# Fall back to legacy build if needed
npm run build:legacy
```

### Data Management

```bash
# Generate standardized data for all locations
npm run standardize:data

# Process a specific location
npm run standardize:one atlanta

# Count and analyze appraiser data
npm run count:appraisers
```

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Maintenance**: All data follows the same structure, making it easier to update and extend.
2. **Better SEO**: Structured data enables rich search results and better visibility.
3. **Improved Performance**: Less data transformation needed at runtime.
4. **Enhanced UI**: Consistent data structure enables more detailed and rich UI components.
5. **Faster Builds**: Streamlined build process that focuses on essential steps.

## Next Steps

1. Continue enhancing the standardized data structure as needed
2. Improve filtering and search based on standardized fields
3. Add admin tools for updating the standardized data
4. Implement analytics to track user engagement
