# Art Appraiser Directory Frontend: Build & Implementation Plan

## 1. Project Overview

The Art Appraiser Directory Frontend is a specialized part of the Appraisily website focused on creating SEO-optimized content for art appraisers and locations. It generates static HTML pages that can be deployed to Netlify or integrated into the main site.

## 2. Environment Setup & Prerequisites

### 2.1 System Requirements
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git for version control
- Access to Appraisily ImageKit account (for image optimization)

### 2.2 Initial Setup
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/main-site-index.git
   cd main-site-index/art-appraiser-directory-frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## 3. Build Process Validation

### 3.1 Testing the Development Environment
1. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Verify the application loads properly in the browser (typically at http://localhost:5173)
3. Check for any console errors or warnings

### 3.2 Test Build Processes
Test each build script to ensure they work properly:
1. Standard build
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Simplified build (for quick testing)
   ```bash
   npm run build:simple
   ```
3. SEO-optimized build
   ```bash
   npm run build:seo-optimized
   ```

### 3.3 Addressing Build Issues
- Fix any TypeScript errors that appear during the build process
- Resolve any dependency issues or version conflicts
- Check console logs for any build warnings or errors

## 4. Image Management & Optimization

### 4.1 Image Validation
1. Run image validation scripts to identify missing or problematic images
   ```bash
   npm run check-images
   npm run check-all-images
   ```

### 4.2 Image Generation & Optimization
1. Generate missing images
   ```bash
   npm run generate-missing-images
   ```
2. Generate all images (if needed)
   ```bash
   npm run generate-all-images
   ```
3. Optimize existing images
   ```bash
   npm run optimize-images
   ```

### 4.3 Placeholder Management
1. Replace missing images with placeholders temporarily
   ```bash
   npm run replace-images-with-placeholder
   ```
2. Replace placeholders with generated images when available
   ```bash
   npm run replace-placeholders-with-generated-images
   ```

## 5. SEO Optimization Implementation

   ```
2. Ensure sitemap references are added to robots.txt

## 6. React Hydration & Performance Issues

### 6.1 Fix Hydration Issues
1. Identify components with client/server mismatches
2. Run the hydration fix script on specific pages with issues
   ```bash
   npm run fix:react-hydration [page-path]
   ```
3. Verify fixes with local testing
   ```bash
   npm run debug:build
   ```

### 6.2 Performance Optimization

  npm run deploy
  ```
- **Option 2:** Integration into main site subdirectory
  - Copy generated files from `dist/` to appropriate directory in main site
  - Ensure routing and paths are correctly configured

### 7.3 Testing Integration
- Verify links between main site and directory pages
- Test navigation and user flow
- Check for any style inconsistencies

## 8. Regular Maintenance Plan
